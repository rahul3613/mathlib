# The Königsberg bridges problem

We show that a graph that represents the islands and mainlands of Königsberg and seven bridges
between them has no Eulerian trail.

/-- The Königsberg graph structure. While the Königsberg bridge problem
is usually described using a multigraph, the we use a "mediant" construction
to transform it into a simple graph -- every edge in the multigraph is subdivided
into a path of two edges. This construction preserves whether a graph is Eulerian.

(TODO: once mathlib has multigraphs, either prove the mediant construction preserves the
Eulerian property or switch this file to use multigraphs. -/
