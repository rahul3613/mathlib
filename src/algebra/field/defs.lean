# Division (semi)rings and (semi)fields

> THIS FILE IS SYNCHRONIZED WITH MATHLIB4.
> Any changes to this file require a corresponding PR to mathlib4.

This file introduces fields and division rings (also known as skewfields) and proves some basic
statements about them. For a more extensive theory of fields, see the `field_theory` folder.

## Main definitions

* `division_semiring`: Nontrivial semiring with multiplicative inverses for nonzero elements.
* `division_ring`: : Nontrivial ring with multiplicative inverses for nonzero elements.
* `semifield`: Commutative division semiring.
* `field`: Commutative division ring.
* `is_field`: Predicate on a (semi)ring that it is a (semi)field, i.e. that the multiplication is
  commutative, that it has more than one element and that all non-zero elements have a
  multiplicative inverse. In contrast to `field`, which contains the data of a function associating
  to an element of the field its multiplicative inverse, this predicate only assumes the existence
  and can therefore more easily be used to e.g. transfer along ring isomorphisms.

## Implementation details

By convention `0⁻¹ = 0` in a field or division ring. This is due to the fact that working with total
functions has the advantage of not constantly having to check that `x ≠ 0` when writing `x⁻¹`. With
this convention in place, some statements like `(a + b) * c⁻¹ = a * c⁻¹ + b * c⁻¹` still remain
true, while others like the defining property `a * a⁻¹ = 1` need the assumption `a ≠ 0`. If you are
a beginner in using Lean and are confused by that, you can read more about why this convention is
taken in Kevin Buzzard's
[blogpost](https://xenaproject.wordpress.com/2020/07/05/division-by-zero-in-type-theory-a-faq/)

A division ring or field is an example of a `group_with_zero`. If you cannot find
a division ring / field lemma that does not involve `+`, you can try looking for
a `group_with_zero` lemma instead.

An instance of `division_ring K` includes maps `rat_cast : ℚ → K` and `qsmul : ℚ → K → K`.
If the division ring has positive characteristic p, we define `rat_cast (1 / p) = 1 / 0 = 0`
for consistency with our division by zero convention.
The fields `rat_cast` and `qsmul` are needed to implement the
`algebra_rat [division_ring K] : algebra ℚ K` instance, since we need to control the specific
