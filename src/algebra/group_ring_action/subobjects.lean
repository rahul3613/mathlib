# Instances of `mul_semiring_action` for subobjects

> THIS FILE IS SYNCHRONIZED WITH MATHLIB4.
> Any changes to this file require a corresponding PR to mathlib4.

These are defined in this file as `semiring`s are not available yet where `submonoid` and `subgroup`
are defined.

Instances for `subsemiring` and `subring` are provided next to the other scalar actions instances
for those subobjects.
