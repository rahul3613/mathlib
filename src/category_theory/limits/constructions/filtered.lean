# Constructing colimits from finite colimits and filtered colimits

> THIS FILE IS SYNCHRONIZED WITH MATHLIB4.

We construct colimits of size `w` from finite colimits and filtered colimits of size `w`. Since
`w`-sized colimits are constructured from coequalizers and `w`-sized coproducts, it suffices to
construct `w`-sized coproducts from finite coproducts and `w`-sized filtered colimits.

The idea is simple: to construct coproducts of shape `α`, we take the colimit of the filtered
diagram of all coproducts of finite subsets of `α`.

We also deduce the dual statement by invoking the original statement in `Cᵒᵖ`.
